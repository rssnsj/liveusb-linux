# This is only a boilerplate for the instance initialization script.
# It receives polydir path as $1 and the instance path as $2.
#
# If you intend to polyinstantiate /tmp and you also want to use the X windows
# environment, you will have to use this script to bind mount the socket that
# is used by the X server to communicate with its clients. X server places
# this socket in /tmp/.X11-unix directory, which will get obscured by
# polyinstantiation. Uncommenting the following lines will bind mount
# the relevant directory at an alternative location (/.tmp/.X11-unix) such
# that the X server, window manager and X clients, can still find the
# socket X0 at the polyinstanted /tmp/.X11-unix.
